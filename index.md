## About Me

I am currently a lecturer at Osaka University. I'm interested in syntax, especially theoretical aspects of generative grammar. Recently, I started to work on computational neurolinguistics.

Before joining Osaka University, I was a post-doctoral research fellow at University of Tokyo (Yohei Oseki's lab). I had obtained my Ph.D in Linguistics from the Department of Linguistics at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. During my Ph.D years, I lost my advisor ([Sam Epstein](https://lsa.umich.edu/linguistics/people/in-memoriam/samuel-david-epstein.html)). However, I got lucky to have [Acrisio Pires](https://lsa.umich.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/tenure-track-faculty/pires.html) and [Marlyse Baptista](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/people/marlyse-baptista) as my advisors.

## Research Interests

- **Creole Formation:** functional features
- **Computational Neurolinguistics:** naturalistic methods, fMRI, MEG
